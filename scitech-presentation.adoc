Hello,
my name is Sean Marquez,
and on behalf of my co-author,
Kevin Chiu
and advisor for this project,
Dr. Sharan Asundi
I'll be presenting on the topic of Model-Based CubeSat Flight-Software Architecture,
using a docs-as-code approach,
developed for the SeaLion Mission.

== SeaLion Mission

_a joint CubeSat mission between the Old Dominion University (ODU), Coast Guard Academy (USCGA), and the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)_

- 3U CubeSat carrying three payloads for on-orbit validation
- to be launched as a secondary payload on a Northrop Grumman Antares Rocket from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), scheduled for March, 2023

As a brief background,
The SeaLion Mission is joint CubeSat mission between the Old Dominion University (ODU), Coast Guard Academy (USCGA), and the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT).
the SeaLion Mission is a 3U CubeSat carrying three science experiments,
to be launched as a secondary payload on a Northrop Grumman Antares Rocket from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF),
scheduled for March, 2023

== Technical approach: Desired Outcomes

[%step]
- should able to guide an implementation
- should provide a traceable mapping between stakeholder needs and software system requirements
- should provide a means to keep requirements and implementation in sync if/when requirements change
- should provide a means to produce human and machine readable views

[.notes]

Before writing a single line of code,
the flight software development team and myself decided very early on that it might be good idea to define what exactly this spacecraft needed to do.
In doing so,
we discovered the need to adopt a technical approach,
one that would address a set of desired outcomes...

== Model-Based + Docs-as-Code Approach

[%step]
**Docs-as-Code Approach**
[%step]
_Principle of writing documentation using the same principles & practices used for developing/maintaining good software_
[%step]
- i.e., content persists in plaintext, as to be version controlled and managed along side code on the local filesystem

[%step]
**Model-Based Approach**
[%step]
_Capturing the contents of the system in a **model**, as opposed to a document_
[%step]
- i.e., content persists in a data model that is both human-readable and machine-queryable

[.notes]
--
To accomplish these desired outcomes,
the team and myself adopted the following approaches...
The first being Docs-as-Code Approach;
Principle of writing documentation,
using the same practices and tools used for developing/maintaining good software.
i.e., content persists in plaintext, as to be version controlled and managed along side code on the local filesystem
The second being the Model-Based Approach;
Capturing the contents of the system architecture in a **model**, as opposed to a document.
i.e., content persists in a data model that is both human-readable and machine-queryable
Using this approach, we were able to downselect a modeling language that allowed us to achieve the desired outcomes...

=== Stakeholder Needs
 
The SeaLion mission architecture is guided by a series of stakeholder needs...

....
include::./stakeholder-needs-mapping.puml[Stakeholder Needs Mapping]
....

[.notes]
--
Using a filesystem-based modeling language,
developed by the Mach 30 Foundation,
we were able to model a set of stakeholder needs,
which in the context of our CubeSat mission are the mission objectives.
The stakeholder needs represent the desires of our stakeholders,
which are then used to derive requirements in a language that is familiar to software developers...
--

=== User Stories

The stakeholder needs are then used to identify a series of user stories...

[plantuml, user-stories-mapping, svg]
....
include::./user-stories-mapping.puml[User Stories Mapping]
....

[.notes]
--
As derived requirements, we then created user stories.
User stories are an approach to capturing software requirements,
familiar to practitioners of Agile software engineering,
represented as a set of use cases performed by a user,
in this case, the ground station operator
--

=== User stories as Use Case Diagram

[plantuml, use-case-diagram, svg]
....
include::./use-case-diagram.puml[User Stories as Use Case Diagram]
....

[.notes]
--
Because user stories are both human and machine readable model elements,
we can auto-generate an alternative view of the user stories as a use case diagram.
--

=== Data Structures

Data structure can also be described and mapped to user stories in the architecture.

[plantuml, data-structures-mapping, svg]
....
include::./data-structures-mapping.puml[Data Structures Mapping]
....

[.notes]
--
Data structure can also be described and mapped to user stories in the architecture.
--

=== Example Data Structure

include::./satellite-health-data.adoc[Satellite Health Data Packet as table]

[.notes]
--
For example,
the following data structure specifies the satellite health data packet,
derived from our a user story.
--

== Conclusion

with a model-based + docs-as-code approach, flight software architecture can: 
[%step]
- guide an implementation directly from stakeholder needs
- ensure traceability between stake holder needs and system requirements
- provide a means to keep requirements and implementation in sync if/when requirements change
- provide a means to produce human and machine readable views (including this presentation!)

== The End
